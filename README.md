# Personal Portfolio â€“ Alejandro Goscu  

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
The idea behind this project is to create a **modern digital business card**, inspired by the traditional ones we used to hand out.  
Instead of paper, you now get an interactive version where I showcase my projects, skills, and a bit of who I am.
